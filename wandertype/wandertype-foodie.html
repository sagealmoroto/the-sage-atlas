          <h3>Who They Are</h3>
          <p>
            The Foodie travels with their senses. For them, food isn’t just a meal — it’s a lens through which they understand the world. They believe the flavors of a country are just as meaningful as its landmarks, and they build their itineraries around what they’ll taste, not just what they’ll see. Whether it’s a fine dining reservation, a night market, or a roadside stall, The Foodie is there for it — curious, open-hearted, and hungry to discover what makes a place deliciously unique.
          </p>
    
          <h3>What They Want to Do</h3>
          <p>
            Their bucket list is less about monuments and more about markets, street carts, and local kitchens. They sign up for cooking classes, take food tours, visit vineyards and spice farms, and always know which neighborhoods have the best bites. A Foodie might plan a trip around a regional specialty — like ramen in Japan, mole in Mexico, or pizza in Naples — and they never forget to ask where locals eat. They’re not chasing trends — they’re chasing flavor with a story.
          </p>
    
          <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
          <p>
            For The Foodie, every bite is a bridge. Food is one of the most intimate expressions of a culture, and sharing a dish means sharing tradition, family history, and regional pride. Foodies aren’t just there to eat — they’re there to learn through taste. Their greatest travel memories often happen over a table: a conversation with a market vendor, a recipe learned from a home cook, or the quiet joy of discovering something they never expected to love.
