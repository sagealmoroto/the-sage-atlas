          <h3>Who They Are</h3>
          <p>
            The Tourist is the classic traveler — the planner, the dreamer, the one who’s been saving for this trip and wants to make it count. They’re not here to go off the grid; they’re here to experience the highlights. They want to see the places they’ve read about in books or seen in films: the Eiffel Tower, the Colosseum, the Great Wall. The Tourist doesn’t view this as cliché — to them, it’s essential. There’s joy in ticking boxes and standing in a place that millions have before. It’s not just travel; it’s witnessing history.
          </p>
    
          <h3>What They Want to Do</h3>
          <p>
            Tourists gravitate toward iconic sights, world-famous museums, UNESCO landmarks, and the top-rated attractions in every city. They’ll wait in line to take a photo, they’ll wear the audio guide headset, and they’ll plan each day to maximize their itinerary. While they may not always go off-script, they often enjoy guided experiences like hop-on-hop-off tours, classic sightseeing routes, and “must try” dishes at renowned restaurants. They find comfort in well-known experiences — not because they’re safe, but because they’re storied.
          </p>
    
          <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
          <p>
            The Tourist travels to feel connected — to the world, to the collective memory of humanity, to the moments that shaped history and the people who shared them. Their journey is about belonging to something bigger. Whether it’s standing in the Sistine Chapel or walking across Tower Bridge, these experiences affirm something deep:
          </p>
    
          <blockquote>“I was here.”</blockquote>
    
          <p>
            It’s not about being original — it’s about participating in the story.
