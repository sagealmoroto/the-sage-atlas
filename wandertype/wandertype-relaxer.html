          <h3>Who They Are</h3>
          <p>
            The Relaxer travels to let go. They’re not interested in climbing mountains or chasing thrills — they want stillness, softness, and space to exhale. A good vacation, for them, is the opposite of their everyday life: peaceful, pressure-free, and low-effort by design. Whether it’s lounging on a beach, sipping wine in the countryside, or taking a long soak in a hot spring, Relaxers seek moments that soothe. Their trips are about restoration — physical, mental, and emotional.
          </p>
    
          <blockquote>“Let me unplug, slow down, and just be.”</blockquote>

          <h3>What They Want to Do</h3>
          <p>
            Think scenic drives, spa days, long naps in hammocks, lakefront strolls, and afternoons with nothing on the itinerary. They’ll often stay in places designed for comfort: boutique hotels, resorts, cabins, or natural retreats. Water is a common element — whether it’s oceans, lakes, hot springs, or infinity pools — but relaxation can also be found in forests, meadows, and quiet mountain towns. They enjoy beautiful surroundings and minimal effort, and may gravitate toward wellness-lite experiences like saunas, gentle yoga, or wine tastings — as long as they’re slow and serene.
          </p>
    
          <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
          <p>
            Relaxers know that the world moves fast, and they travel to move slower. They’re not lazy — they’re intentional. For them, rest is the purpose, not a side effect. Whether they’re recovering from a hectic season of life or just prioritizing peace, travel becomes a way to recenter. They return home not with adrenaline highs, but with clarity, softness, and a full breath they hadn’t realized they were holding.
