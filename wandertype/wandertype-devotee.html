          <h3>Who They Are</h3>
          <p>
            The Wellness Devotee travels with intention. Their trip isn’t just about getting away — it’s about going inward. Whether they're seeking spiritual clarity, emotional grounding, or a break from burnout, they gravitate toward destinations and experiences that support their well-being. Unlike The Relaxer, who seeks peace for peace’s sake, the Wellness Devotee seeks transformation through peace. A trip isn’t complete unless it offers the chance to reset — mentally, physically, or spiritually.
          </p>

          <h3>What They Want to Do</h3>
          <p>
            Wellness Devotees plan their travel around yoga retreats, meditation centers, detox programs, healing ceremonies, and holistic spa experiences. They might be drawn to forest bathing in Japan, sound healing in Peru, tea rituals in China, or ayurvedic practices in India. Their destinations may be serene, but their schedule isn’t always idle — it’s filled with breathwork, journaling, mindful movement, and self-reflection. They value both ancient and modern wellness traditions, and are open to alternative healing practices if they offer the chance to reconnect.
          </p>
    
          <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
          <p>
            This traveler doesn’t just want rest — they want renewal. The Wellness Devotee travels to care for themselves in ways that daily life doesn’t always allow. Whether they’re working through grief, recovering from burnout, or simply seeking clarity and space, wellness travel gives them the tools to re-align. It’s not always about healing — sometimes it’s about growth. But it’s always about listening to yourself, and giving your mind, body, and soul what it needs.
