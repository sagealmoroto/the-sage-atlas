          <h3>Who They Are</h3>
          <p>
            The Culture-Seeker travels with a deep hunger for understanding. They don’t just want to visit a place — they want to feel it, taste it, live it, and if possible, return home changed by it. Culture-Seekers are drawn to destinations with rich histories, layered identities, and living traditions. They might skip the most famous site in a city if it’s packed with tourists and instead spend the afternoon at a local festival or learning a craft in a family-run studio. Their goal isn’t to see everything, but to connect meaningfully with something.
          </p>
    
          <h3>What They Want to Do</h3>
          <p>
            Cultural immersion is their ideal itinerary: wandering historic neighborhoods, attending religious or seasonal festivals, participating in tea ceremonies, visiting sacred sites, or simply sharing a meal with locals. They often seek out traditional music, dance, and art — not in museums, but in the streets, homes, and temples where they originate. Culture-Seekers might enroll in a local class, stay in a guesthouse, or even plan travel around specific rituals or holidays. They aren’t chasing photos — they’re chasing perspective.
          </p>
    
          <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
          <p>
            For the Culture-Seeker, travel is an exchange — a chance to listen, observe, and engage with the beauty and complexity of other people’s ways of life. Their journeys are often humbling, full of awe and quiet reflection. Whether they’re watching a sunrise prayer ritual or learning the steps to a traditional dance, what they seek is truth in context — the small human details that don’t always make it into guidebooks. They return home not just with stories, but with a deeper sense of connection to the world.
